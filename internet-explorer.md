# Apps

## Obsidian

[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) is a note taking tool which saves notes locally in markdown format. It is highly customizable and powerful.

To make most of the Obsidian, I use [Dataview](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview) plugin which generates tables using the metadata of the pages (stored as YAML frontmatter). Dataview uses  a SQL like query language, and also allows to use javascript for complex processing.

## Bludit

[Bludit](https://www.bludit.com/) is flat file CMS which store in flat files. It supports markdown and WYSIWYG editor mode. It is highly customizable, and blazingly fast.
