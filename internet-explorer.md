# Obsidian

Obsidian is a note taking took which saves notes locally in markdown format. It is highly customizable and powerful.

To make most of the [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), I use [Dataview](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview) plugin which generates tables using the metadata of the pages (stored as YAML frontmatter). Dataview uses  a SQL like query language, and also allows to use javascript for complex processing.
