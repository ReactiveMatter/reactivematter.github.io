I needed an internal documentation for my organisation. Dokuwiki instantly came in my mind due to its simplicity and robustness. However, there were no good theme which would look polished and simple.

So, I spend past two weekends in building a minimal and clean template for Dokuwiki. The final result is at [Dokuwiki's website](https://www.dokuwiki.org/template:minimal).

It was my endeavour to keep the template clean, and give enough configurable options to users to make it their own, but not too much options which can be confusing.
