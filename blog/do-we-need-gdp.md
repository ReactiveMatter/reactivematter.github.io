I was reading [one blog of Luke Smith](https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/why-its-bad-to-have-high-gdp/) where he has rightly illustrated that the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) measure only the market transactions and nothing more.

Having a high GDP doesn't always mean a good and healthy economy. Higher GDP growth leads to speculations and betting on future GDP growth rates, which creates bubbles. Then why do we consider GDP as a measure of economy.

We need better indexes to measure the health of the economy which measures things that actually matters to the societies (for e.g. Happiness Index).
