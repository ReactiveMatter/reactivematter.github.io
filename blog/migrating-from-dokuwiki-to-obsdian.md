I have been using Dokuwiki for the past 4 years, and it has served me well till now. However, no offline solution in mobile is very heavy limitation to use Dokuwiki as a personal knowlegement management (PKM) app.

Few months ago, I discovered [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), and I am awestruck since then. It has all the feature required of a wiki-like notes setup. The YAML as frontmatter and flexibility in properties is something Dokuwiki may not be capable of (without any complex plugin and configurati. However, the real power of Obsidian lies in plugins. I am making heavy use of [Dataview plugin](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/).

Therefore, I decided to migrate from Dokuwiki to Obsidian. During the process I have created the a python script which converts my Dokuwiki notes.

You can find the python script at https://github.com/ReactiveMatter/dokuwiki-obsidian.


If you want to use Dokuwiki as you publishing platform from Obsidian, you can use [Obsidian-2-Dokuwiki](https://github.com/vzeller/obsidian2dokuwiki) script by vzeller.
